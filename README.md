# Sound Forest VR

Sound Forest VR (or "Ljudskogen VR") is a project for the DT2300 - Sound in Interaction course at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. This project is based on the installation of the same name, [Ljudskogen.](https://www.kth.se/mid/research/smc/projects/sound-forest-1.897050) In this Unity project, the user will be able to create, handle and interact with sound-emitting objects that respond to input. The goal of this project is to experiment with mapping of sounds to interactions in VR, as well as observe the emergent behaviors that possibly come up from use.

Footage of the project can be seen [here.](https://vimeo.com/398870172)

## Prerequisites

In order to build and run this project, you will need:
* Unity Editor version 2019.2.6f1 64-bit. You may convert the project to work in different versions, but this project was only built and tested using this specific version and therefore is not guaranteed to work with any other versions of the editor.
* Steam and SteamVR. This project uses the SteamVR API for Unity.
* A compatible HMD and controllers. This project has been tested on the Oculus Rift S with Touch controllers as well as the Vive Pro with Vive Wand controllers, and should work with any analogous hardware (Oculus Rift CV1, Oculus Quest, HTC Vive). Bindings for the Index Knuckles and WMR are also available, but this project has not yet been tested with these sets of controllers.
